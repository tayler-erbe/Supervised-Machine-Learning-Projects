    "    Mammography is the most effective method for breast cancer screening\n",
    "    available today. However, the low positive predictive value of breast\n",
    "    biopsy resulting from mammogram interpretation leads to approximately\n",
    "    70% unnecessary biopsies with benign outcomes. To reduce the high\n",
    "    number of unnecessary breast biopsies, several computer-aided diagnosis\n",
    "    (CAD) systems have been proposed in the last years.These systems\n",
    "    help physicians in their decision to perform a breast biopsy on a suspicious\n",
    "    lesion seen in a mammogram or to perform a short term follow-up\n",
    "    examination instead.\n",
    "    This data set can be used to predict the severity (benign or malignant)\n",
    "    of a mammographic mass lesion from BI-RADS attributes and the patient's age.\n",
    "    It contains a BI-RADS assessment, the patient's age and three BI-RADS attributes\n",

    "    collected at the Institute of Radiology of the\n",
    "    University Erlangen-Nuremberg between 2003 and 2006.\n",
    "    Each instance has an associated BI-RADS assessment ranging from 1 (definitely benign)\n",
    "    to 5 (highly suggestive of malignancy) assigned in a double-review process by\n",
    "    physicians. Assuming that all cases with BI-RADS assessments greater or equal\n",
    "    a given value (varying from 1 to 5), are malignant and the other cases benign,\n",
